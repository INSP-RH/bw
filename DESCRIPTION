Title: Dynamic Body Weight Models for Children and Adults
Description: Implementation of the dynamic weight change models for adults from "The Dynamics of Human Body Weight Change" by Chow and Hall as well as the children weight change model from "Dynamics of childhood growth and obesity: development and validation of a quantitative mathematical model" by Hall, Butte and others.
