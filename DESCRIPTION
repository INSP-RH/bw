Title: Dynamic Body Weight Models for Children and Adults
Description: Implementation of the dynamic weight change models for adults from "The Dynamics of Human Body Weight Change" by CC. Chow and KD. Hall (2008) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000045>. As well as the children weight change model from "Dynamics of childhood growth and obesity: development and validation of a quantitative mathematical model" by KD. Hall, NF. Butte, BA. Swinburn, and CC. Chow (2013) <doi:10.1016/S2213-8587(13)70051-2>. These model the physiological processes related to weight change in each individual by considering each of the biological processes involved. This package was developed under funding by Bloomberg Philanthropies.
